## Advice

If you find anything useful in the current repository, please fork or use specific commit version as I have no
intention to keep any API compatibility and versioning.

## Installation

### Update your project root _composer.json_

1 Make sure that repository source has been defined:
```
"repositories": [
    ...
    {"type": "git", "url": "https://github.com/Lacr1ma/facade.git"}
]
```

2 Add the extension to the _require_ section:
```
"require": {
    ...
    "lms/facade": "dev-master"
  }
```
